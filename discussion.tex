Our results imply that auto-suggest interfaces for syntactic search should show candidate relationships augmented with a list of phrases in which they occur. A list of phrases is the most recognizable presentation for clausal relationships, and is as good as a list of words for the other types of relations. A mockup of such a search box is shown in Figure \ref{fig:phrases-mockup}.
