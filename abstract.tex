Previous interfaces for  searching over syntactically parsed text require programming-style queries.
However, a controlled experiment with 400 participants found evidence that showing examples of grammatical relations led to higher recognition accuracy than the baseline of naming the relations alone.  This suggest the use of examples in
an auto-suggest query interface.
