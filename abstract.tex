In the humanities and social sciences, scholars often need to characterize the usage of a word or concept. The ability to issue queries over syntactic relations between words is useful in these situations.  Previous interfaces for  searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries, but most of these scholars lack programming expertise. Auto-suggest is an alternative, but there is no previous work on what auto-suggest options for syntactic relations should look like. A controlled experiment with 400 participants found that syntactic relations are recognized with higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown, than a baseline of naming the relations alone.  This indicates that auto-suggest query interfaces for syntactic search should augment the options with contextual examples.
