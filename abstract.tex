Current approaches to syntactic search are based on issuing structured queries using technical terms. However, a controlled experiment with 400 participants found that syntactic relations are more readily identified from example contexts than from technical terms. This indicates that a more effective approach to syntactic search may be to use auto-suggest that shows candidate relations along with example contexts.
