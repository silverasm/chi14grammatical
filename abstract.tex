A common analysis goal in many fields is to characterize the usage of a word or concept. The ability to issue queries over syntactic relations between words is useful in these situations.  Previous interfaces for  searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries, but programming expertise is scarce. Auto-suggest is an alternative but there is no previous work on auto-suggest for syntactic search. Since the principle of auto-suggest is to show a list of recognizable options to users, we investigated how to present syntactic search options to users in a recognizable way. An experiment with 400 participants found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34\% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown, than a baseline of naming the relations alone.  This indicates that auto-suggest query interfaces for syntactic search should augment the shown options with contextual examples.
