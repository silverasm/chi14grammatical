In the linguistics literature, several tools have been developed recently for querying large collections of syntactically parsed data.  The Finite Structure Query tool for querying syntactically annotated corpora requires its queries to be stated in first order logic \cite{kepser2003finite}.  The popular Stanford Parser includes Tregex, which as the name suggests,  allows for sophisticated regular expression search over syntactic tree structures, and Tsurgeon, which allows for manipulation of the trees extracted with Tregex \cite{levy2006tregex}.
