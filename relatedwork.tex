% Trees are the traditional representation of syntactic parses, so trees are often the focus of query input for collections of syntactically parsed data.

% Several approaches have adopted XML representations and the associated query language families of XPATH and SPARQL. For example, LPath augments XPath with additional tree operators to give it further expressiveness \cite{lai2010querying}.
