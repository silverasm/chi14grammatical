%\section{Experiment 2}
%We hypothesized that words were more helpful when the relations involved distinctive or closed-class words: adverbs are distinctive because they usually end in `ly' -- thoughtfully, helpfully, quickly, etc. Closed-class words include determiners (a, the, that, etc.), pronouns and prepositions.  Our follow-up hypothesis was:

%	H2. If distinctive or closed-class words enter into a grammatical relation, then showing a list of matching words makes it easier to recognize the relation. In other cases, a list of example phrases is more helpful.
%\end{quote}
%
%We conducted a follow-up study to verify this hypothesis. This study was had the same design as the first study: a series of identification tasks in which there was a query word and a relationship. The participants  were shown a list of sentences containing that relationship between the query word and other words, their task was to identify which relationship it was, from a list of 4 choices. Except this time, instead of presenting all the choices in the same way (as a list of matching words, or a list of matching phrases) we presented each choice in the way we thought would be most useful according to our hypothesis. If the hypothesis was true, participants in this `optimal presentation' condition would outperform participants who had all the options presented in the same way.

%The results from this follow-up experiment  confirmed our hypothesis.
